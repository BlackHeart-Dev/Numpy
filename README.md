# Everything I learn in Numpy

### What is NumPy?
####     NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more, and it's short for "Numerical Python" <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/whatisnumpy.html">more...</a>
